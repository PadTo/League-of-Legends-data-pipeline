# 🧩 League of Legends Data Pipeline

- **Status**: Completed
- **Purpose**: Automated, configurable data pipeline for fetching, filtering, and storing _League of Legends_ match data using Riot's official API.
- **Additional Advanced Features to be Added in the Future**:
  - A class that will include functions to fetch data from the tables based on the desired parameters
  - Option to adjust the database structure more easily (including columns, foreign|primary key constraints, etc.)
  - Data gathering limits on stages 2, 3 and 4
  - Adding a column for the match end type for match id's table

---

## 🔍 Overview

This repository contains a modular, rate-limited, and well-logged data pipeline built around the [Riot Games API](https://developer.riotgames.com/). It automates the process of:

- Retrieving ranked match data across tiers and roles
- Filtering relevant events and timelines
- Storing structured results in a local SQLite database
- Preparing clean datasets for statistical analysis and machine learning

# 🔁 API Call Workflow

## Overview

This workflow describes fetching and storing League of Legends match data through Riot Games' API.

![API Call Workflow](photos/API_Call_Workflow.png)

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Input Queue, Tier, Division

- **Input**: Competitive tier (e.g., Challenger, Iron), queue (e.g., ranked, normal), and division (e.g., I, II)
- **API Call**: `/lol/league/v4/entries/{queue}/{tier}/{division}`
- **Action**:
  - Retrieve summoner entries for each tier and division (ranked)
  - Store data in SQL database

### 2. Get Match IDs from puuIDs

- **Fetch**: puuID from the database
- **API Call**: `/lol/match/v5/matches/by-puuid/{puuid}/ids`
- **Action**:
  - Get the list of recent match IDs for each player
  - Store data in an SQL database

### 3. Get Match Data

- **Fetch**: matchID from the database
- **API Call**: `/lol/match/v5/matches/{matchId}`
- **Extract**:
  - Participant-level data
  - Team-level data

### 4. Get Match Timeline

- **Fetch**: matchID from the database
- **API Call**: `/lol/match/v5/matches/{matchId}/timeline`
- **Extract**:
  - Events data
  - Frame-by-frame gameplay data

## ⚙️ Features

### 🔗 Riot API Interface (`riot_api.py`)

- Interacts with Riot’s Match-V5, Summoner-V4, and Spectator-V4 endpoints
- Fetches player PUUIDs, match histories, and timelines
- Implements robust error handling and rate limit compliance

### 🧠 Pipeline Controller (`pipeline_workflow.py`)

- End-to-end orchestration of:
  - Player and match data retrieval
  - Timeline extraction
  - Filter application and database storage
- Enables batch collection and control over sample size and rank tier

### 🧼 Filtering Module (IN PROGRESS)

- TBD

### 🧱 Database Integration (`riot_data_database.db`)

- Lightweight SQLite database setup
- Stores structured data across:
  - Match metadata
  - Participant performance
  - Event sequences and timelines

### 🪵 Logging System (`logs/riot_data.log`)

- Tracks request success/failure and error messages
- Useful for debugging long pipeline runs
- Controlled via `configs/log_config.json`

## 🧪 How to Run

### Installation

To install the RiotAPI Processing Functions locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

<pre>
  git clone https://github.com/PadTo/League-of-Legends-data-pipeline.git
  cd League-of-Legends-data-pipeline
</pre>

Run the following command to install the package locally:

<pre>
  pip install .
</pre>

Make sure you're in the root directory of the project (where setup.py is located) before running the install command.

### ⚙️ Configure the Pipeline

Edit the pipeline_configuration.json file located in the project root. This file contains all runtime settings required by the pipeline:

EXAMPLE:

<pre>
{
  "database_save_location": "YOUR/DESIRED/DATA/PATH",
  "logging_configuration_filepath": "YOUR/DESIRED/LOG_CONFIG_PATH/log_config.json",
  "stages_to_process": [1, 1, 1, 1],
  "rate_time_limit": [100, 120],
  "region": "https://eun1.api.riotgames.com",
  "page_limit": 5,
  "eventTypesToConsider": ["CHAMPION_KILL", "BUILDING_KILL", "ELITE_MONSTER_KILL"],
  "batch_insert_limit": 1000 (Behaves differently based on the stages, but a general parameter to avoid inserting millions of entries in a single query avoiding excessive use of RAM)
}
</pre>

⚠️ CONFIGURATION EXPLANATION:

"database_save_location":
  - Path where processed data will be saved (e.g., a .db or .sqlite file).
  - Example: "./data/match_data.db"
  - Make sure this path exists or the program has permissions to create it.

"logging_configuration_filepath":
  - Path to the logging config file (usually a JSON file).
  - Controls logging behavior: what to log, where to log it, log level, etc.
  - Example: "./config/log_config.json"

"stages_to_process":
  - A list of 4 binary values [1, 1, 1, 1] to toggle pipeline stages.
      - 1 = run the stage
      - 0 = skip the stage
  - Example: [1, 1, 0, 0] runs only stages 1 and 2.
  - Dependency rules:
      - Stage 2 depends on stage 1
      - Stages 3 and 4 depend on stage 2

"rate_time_limit":
  - API rate limit in format [calls, seconds].
  - Example: [100, 120] = 100 requests allowed per 120 seconds.
  - Prevents hitting Riot API limits and being throttled or blocked.

"region":
  - Riot API region URL to query from.
  - Only European regions are allowed (e.g., "https://eun1.api.riotgames.com").
  - Using unsupported regions will break the pipeline.

"page_limit":
  - Controls how many pages of match data are fetched per tier/division in stage 1.
  - Set to -1 to disable the limit (fetch all available pages).
  - Example: 5 = fetch up to 5 pages per bracket.

"eventTypesToConsider":
  - Filters which event types to extract from match timelines.
  - Example: ["CHAMPION_KILL", "BUILDING_KILL", "ELITE_MONSTER_KILL"]
  - Customize to include only relevant game events.

"batch_insert_limit":
  - Maximum number of entries to insert into the database at once.
  - Helps avoid memory overload and improves performance.
  - Default: 1000 (specific behaviour varies based on processing stage, but a general parameter to control the flow of data)
  - Batching prevents issues with RAM usage and large single-query loads.


### Run the Main Script

python main.py

When you run the file, you will be prompted to input your Riot API key. You can choose to replace it or skip it.

<pre>
  Do you want to replace the API key (Y for YES | N for NO)?
  If you type Y, you'll be prompted to enter your Riot API key:
</pre>

Once the key is entered, the pipeline will start and begin processing data.

NOTE:

- The collection process takes a long time (Hours) due to rate limiting (rate limits can be adjusted based on your needs and account constraints related to rates)
- The data WILL NOT be uploaded due to the database having millions of entries
